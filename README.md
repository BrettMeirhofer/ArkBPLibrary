# ArkBPLibrary
 
Contains various shared code / assets for my Ark Survival Mods. If this folder is cloned outside of the Mods folder in the Ark Devkit when a mod is cooked for uploading to steam any assets in that folder referenced by that mod get bundled into the final output mod as a sort of psuedo static library. 




The ctf folder contains components that can be used to make capture the flag mods.

The jukebox folder contains components that can be used for a structure that plays music with a menu for controlling start/stop, volume, and which audio track is playing.

The upgrade folder contains components for a weapon upgrade systems that adds weapons with new modded stats such as a reload speed and recoil reduction.
